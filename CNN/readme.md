## Used CNN to classify pictures of dogs and cats
### Steps:
- First, we will start off with an input image.
- Then I applied filters to the image, which gives us a convolutional layer.
- We then break up the linearity of that image using the rectifier function.
- The image becomes ready for the pooling step.
- After we're done with pooling, we then flatten our pooled feature map before inserting into an artificial neural network.
